    TODO no. 2: Commit Tree

    => We'll use a Tree to save a snapshot of the current directory.

        - Based on those docstrings found in this Tree class, implement the needed methods.

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.message = None
        self.children = []

    def insert_child(self, node: Node):
        self.children.append(node)

    def get_children(self):
        return self.children
